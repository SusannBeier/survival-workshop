## The fundamental problem

We are often interested in the time until some event happens

- death
- death from heart disease
- graduation
- getting a job
- HIV infection
- diabetes diagnosis

When we analyse the data, the event still hasn't happened for some people, or it has but we don't know about it.

## The basic case: right censoring

How long do people survive after surgery for colon cancer with three treatment regimens?

- time starts at surgery
- time ends when someone dies
- they might still be alive when we do the analysis

## Notation: 

- $X$: 'True' survival time 
- $C$: follow-up time -- ie, time until data lock for analysis
- $T$: observed time = $\min(X, C)$
- $\Delta$: Event indicator: $\Delta=1$ if you died at $T$, $\Delta=0$ if you were alive at $T$


We say the time is **right censored** at $T$ for people still alive

- *censored*: the time of death still exists, we just don't get to see it
- *right*: time flowing from left to right; it's the right-hand end we don't see

## Analyses

- **Just look at $\Delta$**: loses information. Biased if $C$ is different by treatment
- **Just look at $X$**: loses information. Biased if $C$ is different by treatment

We need to look at both. Two questions:

- what do we want to do?
- how do we tell the computer to do it?

## Discussion

How are...

- death from heart disease
- graduation
- getting a job
- HIV infection
- diabetes diagnosis

...more complicated when defining time-to-event?

**Pick a couple and talk to the person next to you for 2 minutes**

## Back to the basic case

Want to estimate survival function $S(t)= P(X\geq t)$

But we **don't know** if $X_i\geq t$ when $t$ is after the censoring time.

Three approaches...

- small intervals
- imputation
- maximum likelihood

... all give the same result.

## Data example

Survival from diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis

- rare liver disease
- not (at the time) treatable
- data from before transplants were routine
- follow-up ranging from two to 13 years.

## Discrete time

Round the times to each 5 years

- compute proportion dying for each point: deaths/number under observation
- compute $S(t)$ by multiplying $1-P(\textrm{dying})$ for each time point up to $t$

Biased: the denominator actually changes over the 5 years

What happens as the time intervals get shorter: 10, 5, 2, 1, 1/2, 1/12...

## Example: individual times

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(survival)
data(pbc)

dies<-function(time, status, from, to){
	keep<-time>from
	time<-time[keep]
	status<-status[keep]
	status[time>to]<-0 #I aten't dead
	mean(status)
}

t10<-with(pbc, dies(time/365, status, from=0, to=10))


t5<-with(pbc,c(dies(time/365,status,0,5),
	dies(time/365,status,5,10)))



t2<-with(pbc, c(dies(time/365,status,0,2),
	dies(time/365,status,2,4),
	dies(time/365,status,4,6),
	dies(time/365,status,6,8),
	dies(time/365,status,8,10)))
	
t1<-sapply(0:9, function(from) with(pbc, dies(time/365,status, from,from+1)))	

thalf<-sapply(seq(0,9.5,by=0.5), function(from) with(pbc, dies(time/365,status, from,from+0.5)))	

tmonth<-sapply(seq(0,9+11/12,by=1/12), function(from) with(pbc, dies(time/365,status, from,from+1/12)))	

## Individual points get noisier
plot(1:10,t1,type="h",xlab='Years',ylab="Proportion dying",ylim=range(0,t1))
```

---

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(seq(1/12,10,by=1/12),tmonth,type="h",xlab='Years',ylab="Proportion dying")
```

## Example: survival function

```{r echo=FALSE}
## survival function doesn't
plot(c(0,10), c(1,cumprod(1-t10)),type="s",xlab="years",ylab="Proportion alive", ylim=c(0,1))
lines(c(0,5, 10), c(1, cumprod(1-t5)),type="s",lty=2)
lines(c(0,2,4,6,8,10), c(1, cumprod(1-t2)),type="s",lty=3)

lines(c(0:10), c(1, cumprod(1-t1)),type="s",lty=1,col="blue")
lines(seq(0,10,by=0.5), c(1, cumprod(1-thalf)),type="s",lty=3,col="blue")
lines(seq(0,10,by=1/12), c(1, cumprod(1-tmonth)),type="s",lty=1,col="goldenrod")
```


## Shorter intervals

- Estimate of $P(\textrm{dying})$ in an interval gets noisy for short intervals
- Bias decreases
- Cumulative survival **doesn't** get noisier (proportions kinda sorta independent)
- Can take intervals all the way down to single events!

Kaplan-Meier estimator

$$\hat{S}(t) = \prod_{s\leq t} \left(1-\frac{\textrm{deaths at }s}{\textrm{alive before }s}\right)$$

## Imputation

- Start off with $1/n$ probability at each time point
- Moving through time, when you get to a censored time, spread its probability evenly over all future time points

Ends up with Kaplan--Meier estimator

## Example

(in R)


## Maximum likelihood

What $\hat S()$ makes the likelihood of the data set highest?

- deaths only at observed death times
- If $\Delta=1$, contribution is size of step (predicted proportion dying) at $t_i$ 
- If $\Delta=0$, contribution is total of *future* step sizes

Choosing the step sizes to maximise the likelihood also gives the Kaplan-Meier estimator

## Summaries

- The whole curve $\hat{S}(t)$
- The median (where $\hat{S}(t)=0.5$) and other quantiles
- Survival at particular times (eg, five years, one year, 30 days)
- The **restricted** mean: area under the $\hat{S}(t)$ curve up to some time limit (eg five years)

## Exercise

You, too, can compute the Kaplan--Meier estimator

## Censoring assumptions

Basic assumption: the probability of dying at time $t$ is the same for someone censored before $t$ as for someone being observed at $t$.

In regression models, can weaken this to: the probability of dying at time $t$ is the same for someone censored before $t$ as for someone being observed at $t$ who has the same covariate values.

Formal name: **Non-informative censoring** or **Ignorable Censoring** or **Censoring At Random**

---

It is **impossible** to get an unbiased estimate of ${S}(t)$ without the ignorable-censoring assumption.

You **cannot** test this assumption using the data. 

Sometimes, you can estimate something else useful instead of $S(t)$ (competing risks; tomorrow)


## Common two-sample comparisons

- Median survival
- **% surviving five years** (say)
- restricted mean survival
- **hazard rates**

## Survival at a point

- Estimate $S(t)$ in each group: $\hat{S}_A(t)$, $\hat{S}_B(t)$
- Difference: $\hat{S}_A(\textrm{5 years})-\hat{S}_B(\textrm{5 years})$ has Normal distribution
- Variance of difference: $$\mathrm{var}[\hat{S}_A(\textrm{5 years})]+\mathrm{var}[\hat{S}_A(\textrm{5 years})]$$

Need variances. Easiest to go via the **hazard function**


## Hazard

Rate at which events are happening (eg %/year). Written $h(t)$ or $\lambda(t)$

- Average rate over time:  $(\sum_i \Delta_i)/(\sum_i T_i)$, eg 161 deaths in 2196 person-years of followup gives 7%/year death rate
- As a function of time: is it going up or down? What is the rate at 1 year?

Estimation involves smoothing over short windows of time

## Example:PBC

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(muhaz)
with(pbc, plot(muhaz(time/365, status==2)))
```

## Cumulative Hazard

Written capital $H(t)$ or $\Lambda(t)$

- adding up the hazard over time
- expected number of deaths if people didn't go away when they died
- also $H(t)=-\log S(t)$

Estimator: (Nelson-Aalen)

$$\hat\Lambda(t) = \sum_{s\leq t} \frac{\textrm{deaths at }s}{\textrm{alive before }s}$$


## Example

```{r}
plot(survfit(Surv(time/365,status==2)~1,data=pbc),fun="cumhaz",
     xlab="Years",ylab="Cumulative Hazard")
```

## Related to survival

$$\Lambda(t)= -\log S(t)$$
and
$$\hat{\Lambda}(t)\approx -\log\hat{S}(t)$$
because
$$\log\prod_{s\leq t}\left(1-\frac{\textrm{died}}{\textrm{at risk}}\right)=\sum_{s\leq t}\log\left(1-\frac{\textrm{died}}{\textrm{at risk}}\right)\approx -\sum_{s\leq t} \frac{\textrm{died}}{\textrm{at risk}}$$

## Variance of hazard

Treat each time point as independent Binomial 

$$\widehat{\mathrm{var}}[\hat{\Lambda}(t)]=\sum_{s\leq t} \frac{\textrm{deaths at }s}{\textrm{alive before }s}\left(1-\frac{\textrm{deaths at }s}{\textrm{alive before }s}\right)\frac{1}{\textrm{alive before }s}$$

Not **really** independent, but it **is** valid

So, we can get $\widehat{\mathrm{var}}[\hat{S}(t)]$ from the $S(t)=\exp( -\Lambda(t))$ relationship, and compare $\hat{S}$ between groups.






## More notation

- $N_i(t)$ number of times person $i$ has died by time $t$
- $dN_i(t)$ number of times person $i$ dies at exactly time $t$
- $\bar N(t)$ total number of deaths observed by time $t$
- $Y_i(t)$ is person $i$ under observation at time $t$?
- $\bar Y(t)$ total number of people under observation at time $t$

For right-censored survival data

- $N_i(t)=0$ before $T_i$. After $T_i$, $N_i(t)=\Delta_i$
- $Y_i(t)=1$ until $T_i$, then $Y_i(t)=0$

Looks like pointless complication

## Two reasons

Allows for more complicated processes, eg:

- asthma attacks: $N_i=0,1,2,3,\dots,\textrm{many}$
- getting a job: $Y_i(t)=1$ only while you're looking for a job

Allows some advanced probability theory to be used in proofs

- 'kinda sorta independent' means 'martingale'
- martingales behave a lot like sums of independent things.


## Notation for sums

$$\hat\Lambda(t) = \int_0^t \frac{d\bar N(s)}{\bar Y(s)}$$

It just means
$$\hat\Lambda(t) = \sum_{s\leq t} \frac{\textrm{deaths at }s}{\textrm{alive before }s}$$


## The logrank test

- Compute $d\bar N(s)$ in two groups and take the difference
- Add up over time, weighted according to how much information is available

$$Q = \int_0^\infty w(t)\left(\frac{d\bar N_A(s)}{\bar Y_A(s)}-\frac{d\bar N_B(s)}{\bar Y_B(s)}\right)$$

- If the difference is in a consistent direction, $Q$ will be big
- $Q$ will have a Normal distribution, similar trick for estimating its variance.
- People usually quote $Q^2/\mathrm{var}[Q]$, not $Q$, which has a $\chi^2_1$ distribution

## Weights

If the relative difference is roughly constant, (proportional hazards), we care about how much information is available at each time:

- Want $$\frac{1}{w(s)}\propto\frac{1}{\bar Y_A(s)}+\frac{1}{\bar Y_B(s)}$$

If the relative difference increases or decreases over time, multiply by some increasing or decreasing function of time:

- $\hat{S}(s)^\rho(1-\hat{S}(s))^\gamma$ is a convenient family of functions that can be increasing, decreasing or both
