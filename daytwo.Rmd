## Questions?

## Recurrent events

Nothing in the formulas requires people to go away after they have an event. We don't even need to rewrite the partial likelihood

$$p(\beta)= \frac{\lambda_0(t)e^{z_i(t)\beta}}{\sum_{j\textrm{ observed at } t} \lambda_0(t)e^{z_j(t)\beta}}=\frac{e^{z_i(t)\beta}}{\sum_{j\textrm{ observed at } t} e^{z_j(t)\beta}}$$

Now we are asking about how the **current** value of $z$ affects the rate of events.

Define $Y_i(s)=1$ between the starting time and ending time, $Y_i(s)=0$ otherwise. All the same formulas work. 


We also recurrent events for free<sup>*</sup>!

## Computation

Multiple records, just as for time-varying predictors

More than one record for a given person can end with an event

We need an `id` variable to track which records are the same person

## Issues

Correlation: people who have had an event may be at higher risk of a second

- because the first event really increased their risk (eg sprain)
- because the first event revealed they were at high risk (eg asthma)

Easy to handle: variance estimator using `id` variable, similar to GEE for longitudinal data

- `+cluster(id)` in model formula for R
- `, cluster(id)` option for Stata
- `ID` statement and `COVS(AGGREGATE)` option in SAS

Time scale: should we be comparing

- people at the same time after a fixed time zero?
- people at the same time after their previous event?

Either can make sense: need to think about what you want. 

Therneau & Hamilton (1997, *Statistics in Medicine*) has good examples.
