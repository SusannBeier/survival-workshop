stnum                            Patient ID
age                              Age (years)
hgb                              Hemoglobin (g/l)
tumsize                          Tumor size (cm)
ifp                              Interstitial fluid pressure(marker, mmHg)
hp5                              Hypoxia marker (percentage ofmeas. < 5 mmHg)
pelvicln                         Pelvic node involvement:N=Negative, E=Equivocal,Y=Positive
resp                             Response after treatment:CR=Complete response, NR=Noresponse
pelrec                           Pelvic disease observed
disrec                           Distant disease observed
dftime                           Time from diagnosis to first failure or last follow-up (yrs)
dfcens                           Censoring variable: 1=Failure,0=Censored
failtype                         Failure type: 1 if pelrec, 2 if disrec & not pelrec, 0 otherwise
pelnode                          1 if pelvic nodes negative or equivocal

Because  no  deaths  occurred  before  first  relapse,  death is not considered a competing event in this analysis.

We are interested in the effects of ifp and hp5 on local relapse (ie relapse with failtype==1)
