## Proportional hazards

Examine the proportional hazards assumption for the colon cancer data, and for the time-varying `pbcseq` data set

## Interval censoring

The file `aids.csv` has data on time to AIDS in HIV-positive men early in the epidemic (before highly-effective treatment was available).  For each person, `ltime` is a time when they did not have AIDS and `rtime` is a time when they did.  You will need to replace zero values of `ltime` by `NA`.

Fit models with `survreg()` looking at the effects of `dose`, `stage`, and low CD4 count. Compare lognormal and Weibull (the default) models.
