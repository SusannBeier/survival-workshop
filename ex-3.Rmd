Load the `pbc` data and trying fitting Cox models to one variable at a time from `bili`, `protime`, `albumin`, `age`, `edema`, `stage`.

Draw Kaplan-Meier contour plots for some of them.

Compare the partial likelihood for fits with `bili` and `log(bili)` and for `protime` and `log(protime)`

Fit a model with a selection of variables not including `stage`. Compare fitted survival curves for people at the upper and lower quartiles of these variables.
